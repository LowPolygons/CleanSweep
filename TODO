LOGGING

Refactor commands to return a Result<Option<String>, int>

Ok(None) => Complete program success
Ok(Some) => Failure due to user misuse, correctly caught by code
Err(int) => Failure due to code failure, caught with map_err

Swap all commands to return an ErrorCode and controlled panic, even in case of user input misuse 


Remove MOCK demolish and remove file

There is quite a bit of repetition with the matching in scan and override command

Moving this to the filter category file and preventing repetition makes adding new filters significantly easier

Purge command should affect the underlying to_delete list, only leaving files it failed to delete
