scan --no-filter
  -> This dumps all of the scanned files into the Keep list by default for further run-time user control

override/filter command
  -> This command takes in a required arg [keep, delete], and a --filter [array of values]
  -> These args will represent which list will have the filter acted upon - anything flagged by the list will be moved to the opposing list
  EG: `override keep --filter extension {py, txt, md}`
      -> Any files in the keep list with extensions py/txt/md will be moved into the delete list

To do this, the current FilterCategory need an additional layer of abstraction where the inner logic of keep/delete scanning is not concrete
the filter category itslef could contain a (eg) 'FlaggingObject' which contains one list and will just return if the file is flagged by it
the filter category can then perform the logic of returning true or false
